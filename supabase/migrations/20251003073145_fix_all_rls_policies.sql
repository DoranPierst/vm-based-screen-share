  # Fix All RLS Policies for Custom Auth

  ## Problem
  All policies use auth.uid() which doesn't work with custom authentication.
  Our app uses custom user management, not Supabase Auth.
  
  ## Changes
  - Drop all existing restrictive policies
  - Create new policies that allow anon role access
  - Remove auth.uid() checks since we manage auth in application layer
  
  ## Security Note
  Application-level security is handled through:
  - User ID validation in application code
  - Session management via localStorage
  - Data filtering in API calls
